# About

This is an ***image picker*** app which let's you ***upload pictures*** from your ***mobile device*** into your App.<br>
You are initially prompted with an ***Empty gallery message*** and a button for you to upload your pictures. <br/> 
- In ***ios*** it is possible to select multiple images when ```allowsMultipleSelection: true```
- When not working with ***multiple selection** it is possible to edit the picture before uploading, by setting ```allowsEditing: true```
- There are validations to prevent uploading duplicated images.
- You may delete images individually.
- In this app, there is a ***limit*** of 6 images that can be uploaded, and if it reaches the limit, the upload button gets ***disabled***.
- You are prompted to an ***alert*** message for you to confirm deleting whenever you try to remove a picture.
